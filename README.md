# Unsupervised-Outlier-Detection
Robust algorithm developed to detect shape, magnitude and amplitude outliers in the framework of functional data analysis. Robust measures such as Kendallâ€™s Tau, Biweight micorrelation, Median or Median Absolute Deviation were used. Unsupervised methods for filtering the outliers were tested, such as Boxplot or Carling cut-offs, getting also satisfying outcomes.
